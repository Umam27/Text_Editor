# Text_Editor
Created for course project of CS455

Client : Anyone in need a web-based text-editor

1. Currently all the issues are raised which we think are required for the developement of this software.
2. We have also added an estimated _**six-week developement plan**_ with week-wise fragmentation of solving the issues.
3. _**Overview.pdf**_ file contains the summarized form of requirements and also the ideation of the tech-stacks.\

# Implementation
- The application in its current state supports creation & opening of files and some basic text-editing functionalities
- Earlier we were going to use MongoDB for the database, but due to some difficulties in implementing some functionalities, One of the team mates suggested to shift towards 'localStorage' for our application [ prev work - [TodoList](https://umam27.github.io/to-do-list/)]
- Since the team-members were familiar with working with the 'localStorage', we went ahead with our implementations.
- More details can be seen in the **Discussions.pdf**

# Report
- Initial progress of the team was slow, because of the tech-stacks selection process and learning about them. We catched up with the developement in the mid-phase but again due to some implementation level difficulties, we had to switch to a different plan altogether.
